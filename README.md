## Running the Application
- Ensure that `docker & docker compose` compose are installed on your workstation.
- Some of the variables given below are set up as environment variables, so you may simply change them to suit your needs, modifying the .env file
```
PORTS = 80
BaseAPIURL = https://mfx-recruit-dev.herokuapp.com
SWAGGER_DOMAIN = 127.0.0.1
```
- `PORT` is the port on which the web application will execute
- `BaseAPIURL` is the domain of a third party, and it may vary based on the environment you are utilizing.
- `SWAGGER_DOMAIN` is the swagger domain that will be used for API testing.

To run the heroku, execute the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pdhoang91/heroku.git
`docker-compose up` or `docker-compose --env-file ./.env up`
```
